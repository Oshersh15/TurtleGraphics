Turtle Graphics

Picture a mechanical turtle that moves under the control of a set of precise instructions.
The turtle holds the pen in either the up or down position. While the pen is lowered, the turtle sketches out forms as it moves; when the pen is raised, the turtle moves freely without writing. The turtle possesses a location, an orientation (or direction), and a pen. These are its three attributes.

What I needed to do?
Turtle Methods:

Pen control:
• Drawing state: pendown or penup
Turtle motion:
• Tell turtle state: position, towards x-coordinate, y-coordinate, heading, distance
• Setting and measurement: degrees, radians
  
Screen Methods
• Window control: background colour, clear, screen size
• Animation control: delay

The program is supposed to ask the user which of the pre-organized patterns he would like to be displayed on the screen and to pick a background colour.
